# Bookmarklet Manager

A chrome extension that helps you to manage, easily add bookmarklets on chrome

Road map for development:

1. [ ] File that has all the snippets - Done the file will be a Javascript file with functions

2. [ ] when the file is saved, there should be a re build


Todo:

- Provide Vim editor settings
- Remove functions when they dont appear in `main()`
- allow users to re-use other parts of the code inside the function
- enable jquery on the page first
- display current bookmarklets

- Display a visual error when something went wrong
- Provide feedback when saved
